      <ol>
        <li>
          Data Ownership: The user retains ownership of their data. The

          data stored on its network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Encryption: The decentralized platform must provide encryption
          mechanisms to ensure that data stored on the network is secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Access Control: The decentralized platform must provide
          mechanisms for the user to control who can access their data and how
          it can be accessed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decentralized Storage: The data stored on the decentralized platform

          disruptions or hardware failures.
        </li>

        <li>
          Network Resilience: The decentralized platform must be resilient to

          network's operation and development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Network Consensus Mechanism: The decentralized platform must have a
          consensus mechanism that ensures that the network is secure and that
          all nodes on the network agree on the state of the network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Network Transparency: The decentralized platform must be transparent
          in its operations, and the user must have visibility into how their
          data is being stored and used on the network.
        </li>
        <li>
          User Liability: The user must ensure that the data they store on the
          network is legal and does not infringe on any third-party rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          User Conduct: The user must not use the decentralized platform to
          engage in any illegal or unethical activities, such as storing illegal
          content or engaging in cybercrime.
        </li>
        <li>
